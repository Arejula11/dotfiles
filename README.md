# My prompt configuration in bash and zsh
This repository contains my personalized prompt configuration for both Bash and Zsh shells. The prompt is designed to provide useful information while maintaining a clean and minimalistic appearance.
## Installation
### Bash
1. Copy the contents of `.bashrc` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.

2. Save the changes and restart your Bash shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`).

### Zsh
#### Automatic installation

1. Give execute permission to the `install_zsh.sh` script:

```bash
chmod +x install_zsh.sh
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
./install_zsh.sh
```

#### Manual installation

1. Copy the contents of `.zshrc` to your `~/.zshrc` file.

2. Save the changes and restart your Zsh shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`.
